## I'm not a developer!

Not yet at least.

I work in the cosmetics industry and have been troubled with the state of ERP integrated LIMS software.
They're either too expensive or developed by people that have no practical experience in Quality Control
and cosmetics fabrication workflow.

This module is my attempt to integrate the following features (some of which are partially solved by odoo enterprise):

### Raw materials workflow

- Raw material inspection after receipt
- Lot blocking to prevent use before validation
- Raw material weighing check
- Raw material identification labels

## Product Specifications

- Product specifications are recorded directly on the product/variant form
- Certifications (organic, vegan, COSMOS) may be added to tag raw materials

## Instruments

- Calibration and preventive maintenance tracking
- Calibration notifications, integrated purchase order
- Instrument cleaning schedule
- Instrument identification
- Instrument capacity and resolution records

## Sampling

- Sample identification
- Configurable sample size based on norms and standards (ISO, NBR)
- Multiple sampling per lot (for destructive and non destructive analysis)

## Inspections

- MRP process inspections
- Inspection schedules
- Instrument and standards traceability for each analysis
- Register standardized (ISO, USP, DIN) methods
- Automatically consume quantities of sampled materials
- Supplier performance reports 

and more...

This is an ambitious project and its **main** objective is to help me become a better developer.

DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!
